    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oh no! They've discontinued your favorite dessert, cookie cat! Looks like we've got to make them ourselves.</p>

    <p> Making its first appearance in Season 1 Episode 1 of the hit animated cartoon, Steven Universe, <br>
    Cookie Cat has become a staple in the show. Unfortunately, in the episode it seems that Cookie Cat <br>
    is discontinued for unknown reasons. After some conflict, the episode is resolved with Steven receiving <br>
    a pile of Cookie Cat sandwiches!</p>
    <p> Sadly, we aren't able to taste the original Cookie Cat sandwich. However, we can try our best to <br>
    recreate it! Here's the list of ingredients and how to make your very own Cookie Cat! </p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 and <span>&#189;</span> Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li><span>&#189;</span> cup of Dark Cocoa Powder</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of Baking Powder</li>
        <li><span>&#8539;</span>Teaspoon of Salt</li>
        <li>1 Cup Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>1 and <span>&#189;</span> Cups of Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li><span>&#188;</span> Teaspoon Almond Extract</li>
        <li>4 Quarts of Vanilla Ice Cream</li>
        <li>4 Quarts of Strawberry Ice Cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions <em>(Baking)</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325<span>&#x2109;</span></li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat butter until smooth. Add sugar and mix until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add eggs one at a time and then mix in vanilla and almond extracts. Mix in flour on a low speed.</li>
        <li>Shape dough into 2 discs about an inch thick and wrap them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Roll out dough to Â¼ an inch thick. Cut out cat heads and place them on a lined cookie sheet about an inch apart.</li>
        <li>Use a small oval cutter to cut eyes out of half of the cookies. Bake for 16 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the cookies from the oven. Cool for 2 minutes the cookie sheet and then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Directions <em>(Decorating)</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread strawberry ice cream along a baking sheet to cover 1/4 of the sheet. Use a strip of acetate to hold it in place.</li>
        <li>Repeat with vanilla ice cream and then continue to alternate the two flavors until there are four layers.</li>
        <li>Remove acetate sheets and freeze for a few hours.</li>
        <li>Cut cat shapes out of the ice cream strips so that one eye is strawberry and the other is vanilla (PICTURE at 8:43).</li>
        <li>Place the ice cream on a cooled cookie and then top it with a cookie that has eye holes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The car panini is the product of a silly PBS documentary circulating around Spooner Street forcing <br>
        all the husbands to eat healthy. In a fit of hunger, Peter drives to a nearby gas station to munch on some <br>
        of his favorite snacks. This is where Cleveland Brown, one of Peter's best friends, spots Peter putting all the <br>
        snacks in a Panini press in his car. Cleveland joins Peter asking if he could have a Car Panini as well, this is <br>
        when another random character, presumeably a husband residing in Quahog, asks to have one too. Realizing he may <br>
        have struck gold with his incredibly unhealthy food, Peter decides to open a food truck serving his car panini <br>
        and various other food monstrosities. </p>
